Hello Everyone,

I have added the screenshots with the project in the screenshot folder.
I could not do the front-end part, sorry for that.

I have created the required APIS.

Application Requires:

Node.js
MySQL
Express.js

Steps to run the project :

1. Unzip the project.
2. Add the "battles.sql" file to the database.
3. cd into the project.
4. Do "node bin/www" to run the project and the project will start to run on port 3000.
5. Go and open the browser and enter localhost:3000 into the browser.
6. Login to the project (all the apis will require the user to be logged in).

Project Contains:

1. battles.sql file for the database.
2  Screenshots of the project showing the use of apis.
